# Excel-and-Tableau-Project

Overview
Welcome to my Wealth of Nations data analysis project! In this project, I've explored and visualized the dataset using Excel and Tableau.

Tools Used
Excel: Cleaned, sorted, and filtered the dataset. Implemented data security by password-protecting the workbook. Created informative charts and tables.
Tableau: Imported the cleaned dataset to craft visually appealing and color-blind friendly visualizations.
Highlights
Excel Data Cleaning: Employed Excel for robust data cleaning, ensuring accuracy and coherence.
Workbook Security: Implemented password protection for secure data handling.
Visualizations in Tableau: Utilized Tableau to generate four insightful visuals, specifically designed to meet color-blind requirements.
